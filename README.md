<h2>Project</h2>
<p> I created a Notes App using kotlin . <br>It is designed for users to Manage notes , add them etc.<br>You can list, add , update , delete, load , save very easily and straight foward</p>


<h2>Notes App Features</h2>
<p><strong>Browse Notes</strong> To view all notes saved in the app </p>
<p><strong>Delete Notes</strong> To remove a note you would need to select the Delete Note option and provide the number of the note you would want  to delete from the list.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Notes</strong> If you want to update your note select the Update Note option. This will allow you to modify the content of any of your existing notes.</p>
<p><strong>Save Notes</strong> To save your notes for future reference, select the Save Notes option. This will store all your notes in a JSON file within the app.</p>
<p><strong>Load Notes</strong> To access previously saved notes, select the Load Notes option. This will display all notes you've previously saved in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Search Notes</strong> Use the Search Notes function to find specific notes. Select either Search Title or Search Owner and enter a keyword to look for notes that match your search.</p>
<p><b>Ive Designed this Code to the best of my knowledge, I came accross a lot of problems most were fixed but most were not properly intergrated</p>
